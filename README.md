## **House Price in Washington, USA between 1900 - 2014**

Aims: 
1. To determine whether a machine learning model would be effective in predicting the price of houses based on the selected categories. 
2. To create an interactive page that allows users to select the number of bedrooms and bathrooms, the size of the land, and the year the house was built in order to determine the price of the house. 


## **Data and Data Delivery** 

The dataset used for this was retrieved from Kaggle via https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shree1992/housedata. 
we cleaned the data set to get the columns for price, bedroom, bathroom sqft living sqft built

we then tested the data using the machine learning models 
1 Linear regression 
2 Random forest
3 Desision tree 

we found out that the linear regression model gave the most accurate result

Linear Regression

Random Forest

so we desided do have linear regression as the chosen model for machine learning.

we decided to have a webpage that can predecit the hosue pricing by the usee chosing the year the house was built no. of bedrooms, no. of bathroomsqft living & sqft built.

to build the code we used resoursed available in slack, chat GPT and by trial and error and learning and modifing the code to get thte desired output.
